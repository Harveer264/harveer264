            <h2>Overview of First-Past-the-Post System</h2>
            <p>The First-Past-the-Post (FPTP) electoral system is one where the candidate with the most votes in a constituency wins the seat. It is a simple plurality voting method, widely used in countries like India, the United Kingdom, and the United States for various elections.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Why FPTP Can Be Unfavorable</h2>
            <h3>1. Disproportional Representation</h3>
            <p>FPTP often leads to a significant disparity between the percentage of votes a party receives and the percentage of seats it wins. For example, a party could win 40% of the vote but receive 60% of the seats, leading to over-representation of some parties and under-representation of others.</p>

            <h3>2. Wasted Votes</h3>
            <p>Votes for losing candidates and votes beyond what is needed for the winner to secure the seat are considered "wasted." This can result in a large number of votes not contributing to the election outcome, discouraging voter participation and engagement.</p>

            <h3>3. Encourages Two-Party Systems</h3>
            <p>FPTP tends to favor larger parties and penalize smaller ones, often leading to a two-party system. This can limit voter choice and reduce the diversity of political representation, as smaller parties struggle to gain seats and influence.</p>

            <h3>4. Regionalism</h3>
            <p>FPTP can exacerbate regional divides by encouraging parties to focus on specific areas where they have strong support, rather than appealing to a broader national electorate. This can lead to regional polarization and weaken national unity.</p>

            <h3>5. Tactical Voting</h3>
            <p>Voters may feel compelled to vote tactically, choosing a less-preferred candidate who has a better chance of winning over their preferred candidate, to prevent a least-preferred candidate from winning. This undermines true voter preferences and can distort election results.</p>

            <h2>Alternatives to FPTP</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Proportional Representation (PR)</strong>: Ensures that the percentage of seats a party wins is roughly equivalent to its percentage of the vote.</li>
                <li><strong>Ranked Choice Voting (RCV)</strong>: Allows voters to rank candidates in order of preference, helping to ensure that the winning candidate has broad support.</li>
                <li><strong>Mixed-Member Proportional (MMP)</strong>: Combines FPTP and PR, with some representatives elected in single-member districts and others from party lists.</li>
