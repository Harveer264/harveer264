            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div class="section">
            <h2>Benefits of Indian Democracy</h2>

                <h3>1. Representation and Accountability</h3>
                <p>In India, elected officials are accountable to the people, promoting transparency and responsiveness. Citizens have the power to vote out leaders who do not meet their expectations.</p>

                <h3>2. Protection of Rights</h3>
                <p>India's democratic system enshrines fundamental rights and freedoms in its constitution, safeguarding individual liberties and ensuring that citizens can express their opinions and participate in the political process.</p>

                <h3>3. Political Stability</h3>
                <p>India has a history of peaceful transitions of power through regular elections, which helps maintain political stability and reduces the likelihood of violent conflicts or coups.</p>

                <h3>4. Economic Growth</h3>
                <p>Democratic governance in India has provided a stable environment for economic growth and development, attracting investment and fostering innovation.</p>

            <h2>Drawbacks of Indian Democracy</h2>
            <button class="button" onclick="toggleContent('drawbacks')">Show Drawbacks</button>
            <div id="drawbacks" class="content">
                <h3>1. Tyranny of the Majority</h3>
                <p>Democracy in India can sometimes lead to the "tyranny of the majority," where the interests of minority groups are overlooked or oppressed by the majority. This can result in social and economic inequalities.</p>

                <h3>2. Inefficiency</h3>
                <p>Democratic decision-making processes in India can be slow and cumbersome, as they often require extensive debate and consensus-building, which can hinder timely action.</p>

                <h3>3. Short-Term Focus</h3>
                <p>Politicians may prioritize short-term gains to win elections, rather than focusing on long-term solutions. This can lead to policies that are popular but not necessarily in the best interest of the country.</p>

                <h3>4. Populism</h3>
                <p>Indian democracy is susceptible to populism, where leaders appeal to popular desires and prejudices rather than rational policy. This can result in the election of leaders who may undermine democratic institutions and norms.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While Indian democracy has many benefits, it also has its drawbacks. It is not a perfect system and requires constant vigilance and participation from its citizens to function effectively. Ultimately, whether democracy in India is a blessing or a disguise depends on how well it is implemented and maintained in the country.</p>
