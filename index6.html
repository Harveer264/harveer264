        <p>
            During election campaigns in India, politicians often make grand promises to win votes. These promises can include commitments to improve infrastructure, provide better public services, and address social issues. However, many of these promises are made without a clear plan for implementation or adequate resources. As a result, voters may be left disappointed when the promises are not fulfilled.
        </p>
        <p>
            The gap between political promises and actual outcomes can undermine public trust in the democratic process and political institutions. It's essential for voters to critically evaluate campaign promises and hold elected officials accountable for their commitments.
