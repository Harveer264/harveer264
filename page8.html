            <h2>Early Inauguration of Ram Mandir</h2>
            <p>
                The Ram Mandir in Ayodhya has been a subject of political interest for decades. 
                The early inauguration of the temple was strategically timed to garner votes 
                for the upcoming elections. Political leaders aimed to use religious sentiments 
                to attract voters. However, this move <span class="highlight">backfired</span> 
                when it became clear that the inauguration was more of a political stunt than a genuine religious event.

            <h2>False Illusions in the Name of God</h2>
            <p>
                Politicians often create false illusions in the name of religion to manipulate public opinion. 
                They promise divine intervention and blessings in return for votes. This not only undermines 
                the sanctity of religion but also misleads the public. The use of religious symbols and narratives 
                for political gain has become a concerning trend in Indian politics.

            <h2>Division Based on Religion</h2>
            <p>
                One of the most troubling aspects of religion-based politics is the deliberate division of people 
                along religious lines. Politicians exploit religious differences to create a sense of "us vs. them," 
                leading to social discord and conflict. This divisive strategy not only harms social cohesion but also 
                undermines the pluralistic fabric of Indian society.
